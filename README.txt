Whilst this project is open-source, I do not allow anyone to tinker with my code UNTIL the product has been created. Then I will open it up for modding.
However, should you wish to FAIRLY contribute to my work, feel free to fork this repository and tinker. Should your ideas be accepted, you will receive due credit.
